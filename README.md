# Steps to follow:
## Step 1 - Logging into coding environment
### Step 1a - Logging into Google Colab
** If you don't have a google account, skip to Step 1b **
- Go to [https://colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com)
- Sign in to your google account
- If you are new to google colab notebook, watch this Youtube video -  [Get started with Google Colaboratory (Coding TensorFlow)](https://youtu.be/inN8seMm7UI)

### Step 1b - Jupyter Notebook in Browser
** If the notebook disconnects/ dies often, consider Step 1c. Many students have reported that that connection is not stable**
- Go to [https://jupyter.org/try](https://jupyter.org/try)
- Click on "Try Jupyter with Python". This will launch an online jupyter notebook using binder

### Step 1c - Jupyter Notebook Installation
- If you want to install jupyter notebook into your computer,
	- Go to [https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/),
	- Download `Anaconda` and
	- Install it
	- Click `Start > Anaconda > Jupter Notebook` (in Windows)

## Step 2 - Opening a notebook
- Click `File > New Python 3 Notebook` to create a new `.ipynb` file online
- Wondering what's a notebook?
    - Think of it like a word document where you can write your python code, run and see the outputs, add comments and notes, insert images, etc. in one place.
